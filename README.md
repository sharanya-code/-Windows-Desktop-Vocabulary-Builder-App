# -Windows-Desktop-Vocabulary-Builder-App
This app shows the user one new word and its meaning everyday to help build the users vocabulary.
This app was made using python in the PyCharm IDE.
I have used Beautiful Soup and Requests Library to web scare the required information from the Internet.
I have also used the win10toast library to help in windows notifications.
